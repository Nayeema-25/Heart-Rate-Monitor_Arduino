Code Explanation: Heart Rate Sensor Using Arduino

This Arduino program reads the pulse sensor data, processes it, and blinks the built-in LED when a heartbeat is detected. It also sends the sensor values to the Serial Plotter for visualization.




° Code Breakdown

1. Define Constants & Variables

int const PULSE_SENSOR_PIN = 0;   // 'S' Signal pin connected to A0
int Signal;                       // Stores ADC data (range: 0-1024)
int Threshold = 550;               // Defines a beat detection threshold

PULSE_SENSOR_PIN = 0 → The sensor is connected to Analog Pin A0.

Signal stores the analog value read from the sensor.

Threshold = 550 → A value above 550 is considered a heartbeat.





2. Setup Function (Runs Once)

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  // Built-in LED will blink with heartbeats
    Serial.begin(9600);            // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate
}

The built-in LED (on most Arduinos, it's on Pin 13) is set as an output.

Serial.begin(9600); → Initializes communication with the Serial Monitor for debugging.





3. Loop Function (Runs Continuously)

void loop() {
    Signal = analogRead(PULSE_SENSOR_PIN); // Read the sensor value
    Serial.println(Signal);                // Send the signal value to Serial Plotter

Reads the analog value from the pulse sensor.

Prints the value to the Serial Plotter for visualization.





4. Heartbeat Detection & LED Blinking

if(Signal > Threshold){                // If the signal is above threshold, turn on the LED
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    } else {
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);     // Else turn off the LED
    }

If the sensor reading is above 550, it turns ON the LED.

If the signal drops below 550, the LED is turned OFF.

This simulates the heartbeat by blinking the LED.





5. Small Delay for Stability

delay(10);  // Short delay for stable readings
}

A 10ms delay ensures smooth data flow to the Serial Plotter.



 How This Code Works in Real Life

1. Connect the pulse sensor to A0.


2. When you place your finger on the sensor, it detects the heartbeat.


3. The LED blinks with each beat.


4. You can see the heart rate waveform in the Serial Plotter.
